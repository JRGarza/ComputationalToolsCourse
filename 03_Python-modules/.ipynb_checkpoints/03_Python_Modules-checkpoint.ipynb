Our star, Kepler 56, have a very high density in the core, about $20\\%$ of its mass is concentrated in $1\\%$ of its radius, this typicaly the case of low mass stars during the Red Giant Branch (RGB). During this phase the helium core is contracting while the enveloppe expands and the hydrogene burn in a shell. The contraction results in an extremly high core density, the helium even becomes degenrated for stars with masses below $2.2 M_\\odot$. The other observations we can make is about the temperature in the core, this temperature is about twice the solar core temperature, at this point the dominating energy generation process become the CNO cycle.\n",
